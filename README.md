# Django_RSET_API


Overview:

This project is a RESTful API built using Django and Django REST Framework (DRF). It serves as a backend service that provides data management and operations through RESTful endpoints. The API supports various CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, allowing clients to interact with the data efficiently.

Functions:

•RESTful Endpoints: Offers a set of well-structured endpoints for managing resources.
• Authentication: Implements token-based authentication for secure API access.
•Pagination: Supports pagination for large datasets.
•Filtering and Search: Allows filtering and searching through query parameters.
•Serialization: Uses serializers to convert complex data types to native Python data types and vice versa.
•Error Handling: Provides standardized error responses.


 Usage:
- Access the API at `http://localhost:8000/api/` (adjust based on your configuration).
- Use tools like Postman or cURL to interact with the endpoints.

  API Endpoints
  • GET /api/resources/: Retrieve a list of resources.
  • POST /api/resources/: Create a new resource.
  • GET /api/resources/{id}/: Retrieve a single resource by ID.
  • PUT /api/resources/{id}/: Update a resource by ID.
  • DELETE /api/resources/{id}/: Delete a resource by ID.
